                    <p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Migration process:</p>
                    <p>
                        1) After clicking the "Continue mining for more profits" button, you will see instructions in a popover, which usually consists of three steps: "Authorize the pool to access XXX", "Unlock assets from original pools" and "Migrate unlocked assets to new pool". Your signature is needed for each step.
                    </p>
                    <p>2) Migration will finish after you sign all the three steps. </p>

                    <h3 class="question">7.Why does 'My Earned' show “0”?</h3>
                    <p>There are several reasons:</p>
                    <p>
                        1) The amount of SUN you earned is too small. Our asset field displays three digits after the decimal point and the number won’t show if it is too small.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2) You have just staked your tokens, and the number won’t be displayed immediately. So please wait patiently until the information shows.
